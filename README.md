# PdfReaderChatGpt

## Project Overview
PdfReaderChatGpt is a web application that leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT and Langchain's tools to provide users with an intuitive PDF reading and querying experience. Users can upload a PDF document, input a query, and receive relevant responses extracted from the document using advanced natural language processing techniques.

## Features
- Upload PDF files for processing
- Perform similarity searches on the PDF content
- Retrieve and display responses based on the user's query
- Uses OpenAI's GPT for generating responses

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- OpenAI's GPT (via OpenAI API)
- Langchain
- Chroma for vector storage
- PyPDFLoader for PDF processing

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gopikrishna152/Pdf_reader.git
    cd Pdf_reader
    ```

2. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key:

    - Create a file named `api_key.py` in the root directory of the project.
    - Add your OpenAI API key to this file:
      ```python
      api = "your_openai_api_key_here"
      ```
    - Ensure the `api_key.py` file is imported and the key is set in your environment.

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit application:

    ```bash
    streamlit run chromdb.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the local Streamlit server (usually http://localhost:8501).

3. Upload a PDF document using the file uploader interface.

4. Enter a query in the text input field.

5. View the response generated by the application based on the content of the uploaded PDF.

## Code Explanation

### Main Functions

- **pdf_loader(pathname)**:
  - Loads and splits the PDF document into pages.
  - Uses Chroma to create a vector store from the document pages.
  
- **similarity_search(query, path)**:
  - Uses the `pdf_loader` function to load the PDF.
  - Performs a similarity search on the document content based on the user's query.
  - Uses the ChatGPT model to generate a response.

- **main()**:
  - Streamlit application layout.
  - Handles file uploading, query input, and displaying responses.

- **loader_interface()**:
  - Manages the file upload process in Streamlit.
  - Saves the uploaded PDF file to a specified directory.
